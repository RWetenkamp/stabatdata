## abstract
Wherever you share your personal data, you will never know exactely if your data is stored, deleted or used correctly and legal compliant. The purpose of this project is to find a data format technology which deletes itself after a set period of time. 
## goal
Defining a data format or a technology which can be used in several web applications. 
## way of work
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project. You could write down your ideas in specified .md-files, you can contribute by coding or testing.

I really do not know if this is possible ... But there is just one way to find out: Trying. And if we succeed, we maybe found a way to enable more privacy.
